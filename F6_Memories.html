	TMS school is a former boys' school. This school is also a former primary school, namely Tuanku Muhammad Primary.
    <p>
	The school still maintains a colonial building overlooking a field built by the English Government in 1930.
	<p>
	Tuanku Muhammad's school began with an English class which was opened by Mr. Pyne, a clerk.
	<p>
	This class is housed in an old building near the Union Building which is currently the United Bus Company Building.
	<p>
	In 1908, Kuala Pilah English School was opened as a private school. The school is housed in the Court Building in the Old District Office.

	Kuala Pilah English School was funded by a local philanthropist, the late En. Tung Yen and during that time the headmaster was Mr. De Witt.

	In 1914, the Government English School was opened. His first headmaster was Mr. J. W. Moore. 
	<P>
	When it opened, the number of students was 21 and by the end of the year, the number of students had increased to 51.
